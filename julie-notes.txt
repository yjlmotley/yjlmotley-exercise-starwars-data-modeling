* that models is attached to diagram_v3.png
* difference b/n models_v2 & models_v3 is that ...
    * models_v3 uses datime.timezone.utc so it refers to the coordinated universal timezone
    * It also uses ondelete='CASCADE' so that the rows (user.id, character.id, planet.id) 
    gets deleted as well from the Favorite & User table when the respective user, planet, or character gets deleted.
